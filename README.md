## Akane
Akane is a bot built on [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) that I made out of boredom and weebness, this bot has a bunch of tools for anime fans.

NOTE: currently offline so no invite link available, feel free to host it yourself.

Also if you were curious Akane refers to Akane Mizuno from Tsuki ga Kirei.
